https://github.com/tranquangchau/remove-css-not-need/settings/branches
	The default branch is considered the “base” branch in your repository, against which all pull requests and code commits are automatically made, unless you specify a different branch.
	Protect branches to disable force pushing, prevent branches from being deleted, and optionally require status checks before merging. New to protected branches? Learn more.

https://github.com/tranquangchau/remove-css-not-need/settings/hooks
	Webhooks allow external services to be notified when certain events happen within your repository. When the specified events happen, we’ll send a POST request to each of the URLs you provide. Learn more in our Webhooks Guide.
	
	More Webhooks Guide
	Webhooks allow you to build or set up integrations which subscribe to certain events on GitHub.com. When one of those events is triggered, we'll send a HTTP POST payload to the webhook's configured URL. Webhooks can be used to update an external issue tracker, trigger CI builds, update a backup mirror, or even deploy to your production server. You're only limited by your imagination.
	Each webhook can be installed on an organization or a specific repository. Once installed, they will be triggered each time one or more subscribed events occurs on that organization or repository.
